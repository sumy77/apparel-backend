**Note**  
The `node_modules` folder will not be transferred, we can do npm install later on remote server itself to pull down required node packages. Node version used to build this application is node v20.2.0.

Api documentation/collection is given in api-docs folder on root. You can import that file in postman to test the endpoints.
